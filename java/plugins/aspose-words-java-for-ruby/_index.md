## Introduction

### Rjb - Ruby Java Bridge

RJB is a bridge program that connect between Ruby and Java with Java Native Interface. Rake + Rjb is the more powerful and useful build tool than both Maven and Ant, I
believe. You can test your Java business logic class itself with Rjb's mock. It helps to migrate Struts's Model Object into your RoR application. But beware to build
Swing application, Ruby (and Rjb) doesn't consider JVM's native threads handling.

### Aspose.Words for Java
