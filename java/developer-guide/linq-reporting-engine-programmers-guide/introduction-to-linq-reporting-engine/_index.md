LINQ Reporting Engine is a part of the [Aspose.Words](http://www.aspose.com/java/word-component.aspx) component that enables you to build reports using an extended set of reporting features. The engine enables you to reference business objects of your application in report templates directly, which agrees well with [Domain-Driven Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) widely used in modern software development. Moreover, the engine uses a subset of C# language in its template syntax. These features enable you as a developer to compose report templates in a familiar and intuitive way.
