You can insert contents of outer documents to your reports dynamically using doc tags. A doc tag denotes a placeholder within a template for a document to be inserted during runtime. 

Syntax of a doc tag is defined as follows.

**&lt;&lt;doc [document_expression]&gt;&gt;**

**Note –** A doc tag can be used almost anywhere in a template document except textboxes and charts.

An expression declared within a doc tag is used by the engine to load a document to be inserted during runtime. The expression must return a value of one of the following types:

- A byte array containing document data
- An [InputStream](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html) instance able to read document data
- An instance of the Document class
- A string containing a document URI, path, or Base64-encoded document data

While building a report, an expression declared within a doc tag is evaluated and its result is used to load a document which content replaces the doc tag then.

**Note –** If an expression declared within a doc tag returns a stream object, then the stream is closed by the engine as soon as a corresponding document is loaded.

By default, a document being inserted is not checked against template syntax and is not populated with data. However, you can enable this by using a build switch as follows.

**&lt;&lt;doc [document_expression] -build&gt;&gt;**

When a build switch is used, the engine treats a document being inserted as a template that can access the following data available at the scope of a corresponding doc tag:

- Data sources
- Variables
- A contextual object (see “ REF contextual Using Contextual Object Member Access” for more information)
- Known external types (see “ REF knownTypes Setting up Known External Types” for more information)
