Sometimes you need to add a group shape into a Word document.Â In Microsoft Word, you can quickly add a group shape using Group command/button. A group shape consists of multiple shapes. Individual shape in a group can be moved separately.

In Aspose.Words it is very easy to add a group shape using [GroupShape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/words/com.aspose.words/classes/GroupShape) class. Shape is created separately using [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/words/com.aspose.words/classes/Shape) class and then added in [GroupShape](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/words/com.aspose.words/classes/GroupShape) object using [AppendChild](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/words/com.aspose.words/classes/groupshape/methods/appendChild\(com.aspose.words.Node\)/) method.

Below are some of the Shape types supported in Aspose.Words. For complete list, please visit [ShapeType](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/words/com.aspose.words/constants/ShapeType)

- Rectangle
- RoundRectangle
- RoundRectangle
- Ellipse
- Diamond
- Triangle
