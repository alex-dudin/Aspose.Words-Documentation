## **DrawingML now is a Composite Node**

DrawingML node is CompositeNode now. That is why VisitDrawingML method in DocumentVisitor was replaced with VisitDrawingMLStart and VisitDrawingMLEnd pair. 

## **Extrusion Effect for DrawingML Supported**

We have now added support of extrusion effect for DrawingML. To enable that effect setting of flag SaveOptions.DmlRenderingMode to DmlRenderingMode.DrawingML is required, by default SaveOptions.DmlRenderingMode is equal to DmlRenderingMode.Fallback.

## **LayoutEnumerator Supports Moving between Logical Siblings**

We have now added two new members to LayoutEnumerator. It is now possible to move between logical siblings and thus find, for example, where paragraph is broken across pages.
