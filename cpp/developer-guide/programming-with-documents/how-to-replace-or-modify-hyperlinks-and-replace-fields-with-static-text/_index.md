## Replace or Modify Hyperlinks

To find and modify hyperlinks it would be nice to have some sort of Hyperlink object with properties, but in the current version, there is no built-in functionality in Aspose.Words to deal with hyperlink fields.

Hyperlinks in Microsoft Word documents are fields. A field consists of the field code and field result. In the current version of Aspose.Words, there is no single object that represents a field. Aspose.Words represents a field by a set of nodes: FieldStart, one or more Run nodes of the field code, FieldSeparator , one or more **Run** nodes of the field result and FieldEnd.

While Aspose.Words does not have a high-level abstraction to represent fields and hyperlink fields in particular, all of the necessary low-level document elements and their properties are exposed and with a bit of coding you can implement quite sophisticated document manipulation features.

This example shows how to create a simple class that represents a hyperlink in the document. Its constructor accepts a **FieldStart** object that must have FieldType.FieldHyperlink type. After you use the **Hyperlink** class, you can get or set its **Target** , **Name** , and **IsLocal** properties. Now it is easy to change targets and names of the hyperlinks throughout the document. In the example, all of the hyperlinks are changed to “[http://aspose.com](http://aspose.com/)”.

Below example finds all hyperlinks in a Word document and changes their URL and display name.
