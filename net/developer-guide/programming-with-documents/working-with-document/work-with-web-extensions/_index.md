Aspose.Words API provides the [WebExtensions ](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/words/aspose.words.webextensions/)namespace that provides various classes to customize elements and attributes extending the XML vocabulary for representing Office Add-ins.

- The [TaskPaneCollection ](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/words/aspose.words.webextensions/taskpanecollection)class is used to specify a list of persisted task pane objects
- The [TaskPaneDockState ](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/words/aspose.words.webextensions/taskpanedockstate)enumeration defining all available locations of task pane object
