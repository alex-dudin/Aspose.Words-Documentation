## Getting Started

### Introduction

### Why Aspose for NPOI HWPF and XWPF?

The developers looking for file format APIs may need to walk through the features provided by the APIs available on the market. Mostly following factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required to use the API
- Comparison between libraries to determine which is better

If you are a .NET developer looking to choose a file format API to process files, you may want to compare NPOI with Aspose.

Project Aspose.Words for NPOI (HWPF and XWPF) shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Words .NET APIs in comparison with NPOI. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Words APIs but not in NPOI for dealing with word processing documents.

This project is helpful for developers who want to compare NPOI with Aspose.Words OR migrate from NPOI to Aspose.Words.

### What's NPOI

NPOI is the .NET version of POI Java project at <http://poi.apache.org/>. POI is an open source project which can help you read/write xls, doc, ppt files.

### What's HWPF and XWPF

**HWPF** is the name of Apache POI port of the Microsoft Word 97(-2007) file format to pure Java. It also provides limited read only support for the older Word 6 and Word 95 file formats. It is still in early development.

**XWPF** is partner to HWPF for the new Word 2007 .docx format is *XWPF*. Whilst HWPF and XWPF provide similar features, there is not a common interface across the two of them at this time. It has a fairly stable core API, providing read and write access to the main parts of a Word .docx file, but it isn't complete.

Both HWPF and XWPF provides Basis Text Extraction, Specific Text Extraction, Access of Header & Footers and Changing Text features.
