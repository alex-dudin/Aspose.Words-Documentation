## About DOC

## DOC in Aspose.Words

Aspose.Words can read DOC files created by the software listed below. When Aspose.Words writes a DOC file, the same set of software can read it:

- Microsoft Word versions 95 to 2016.
- Microsoft Word for Macintosh 98 to X.

## Comprehensive Support for DOC

The DOC format is very complex because it needs to represent modern word processing documents that have richly formatted content and complex layout. There are hundreds of elements, structures and formatting attributes defined in the DOC format. The distinct advantage of Aspose.Words is the great extent to which it supports the DOC format. It is hard or impossible to find the same level of support for many important DOC features elsewhere. Aspose.Words for .NET and Aspose.Words for Java support the DOC format equally well. In addition to all the common DOC features such as paragraphs, tables, styles, lists and fields, Aspose.Words fully supports most of the advanced DOC features:

- Revisions.
- Images, textboxes, AutoShapes and group shapes.
- Linked and embedded OLE objects, ActiveX controls.
- VBA projects with and without digital signatures.
- Embedded TrueType fonts.
- Encrypted documents.
- Documents in right-to-left languages and complex scripts.

When shopping for a solution that claims to support DOC files, make detailed enquires about the level to which the DOC features are supported. Create a complex test file and run it through the proposed solution. You will often find that many document elements and formatting will be lost. Shapes, textboxes, fields, columns, OLE objects, revisions, right-to-left text are among the features that usually suffer. Then run the same document through Aspose.Words and enjoy the unmatched completeness of the DOC format implementation. A complex DOC file generated by Aspose.Words and opened in Microsoft Word.
