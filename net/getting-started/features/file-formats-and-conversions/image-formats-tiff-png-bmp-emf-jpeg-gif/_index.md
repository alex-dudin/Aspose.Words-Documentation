|![todo:image_alt_text](image-formats-tiff-png-bmp-emf-jpeg-gif_1)|<p>[TIFF ](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/)- Tagged Image File Format - is a file format for storing raster graphics images. The TIFF format is widely supported by scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition, image manipulation, desktop publishing and page layout applications.</p><p>TIFF is a flexible, adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied image compression) defining the image's geometry.</p>|

### TIFF in Aspose.Words

With Aspose.Words you can easily render any page or pages of the document and save them into a single-page or multi-page TIFF. All pages rendered by Aspose.Words to the TIFF format are shown side by side below. In the actual file, each page of the document is rendered to one frame in the TIFF file. ImageSaveOptions class can be used to specify additional options when saving a document into the TIFF format. Please refer to the following article for more details and examples:

## About PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

|![todo:image_alt_text](image-formats-tiff-png-bmp-emf-jpeg-gif_2)|[PNG ](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/)- Portable Network Graphics - is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most widely used lossless image compression format on the Internet. PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and therefore does not support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK. A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of "chunks", encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks.|

### PNG in Aspose.Words

With Aspose.Words you can easily render a page of the document and save it as a PNG image. The ImageSaveOptions class allows you to specify a variety of options which control how the image is rendered. For example, ImageSaveOptions.HorizontalResolution and ImageSaveOptions.VerticalResolution are used to set and get the horizontal and vertical resolution for the generated image. The following code example shows how to set these properties for the generated image.

|![todo:image_alt_text](image-formats-tiff-png-bmp-emf-jpeg-gif_8)|[JPEG ](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/)stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a standard method of compressing photographic images. And JPEG file format it is image format which employs this compression.<br>The JPEG compression algorithm is at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color. For web usage, where the amount of data used for an image is important, JPEG is very popular. JPEG is also the most common format saved by digital cameras.|

## About GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

|![todo:image_alt_text](image-formats-tiff-png-bmp-emf-jpeg-gif_10)|[Gif ](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/)- Graphics Interchange Format - is a bitmap image format that which supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make the GIF format less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous color, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color..|
