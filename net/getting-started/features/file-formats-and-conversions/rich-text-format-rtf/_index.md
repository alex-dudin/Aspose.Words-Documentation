## RTF in Aspose.Words

Aspose.Words can read and write files in the RTF format of any version.Â The RTF specification is a set of keywords. There are over 1400 keywords in the RTF 1.9 Specification and Aspose.Words API fully supports (reads and writes) most of these keywords. It is hard to find a similar level of implementation in other products. Unknown keywords (unsupported or from newer specifications) are safely ignored.
